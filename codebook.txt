This is the codebook. 

In this script the reading in of the data can be confusing
when using file.choose() The object assightments :
features receives features.txt
activities '' activity_labels.txt
tr.sub '' subject_train.txt
tr.x '' x_train.txt
tr.y '' y_train.txt
ts.sub ''subject_test.txt
ts.x '' x_test.txt
ts.y '' y_test.txt 
 
The variables were extracted based on mean() and std() being in the title of the variable/feature. I chose to use escape characters to exclude Freqmean 
as it did not seem to be appropriate for the analysis. It is more of a measurement of distribution than average.  

When clarifying the final variable/feature, I made the following substitutions in a text editor, as opposed to within R. I chose to do this 
in a text editor so that I could carefully read the names and not make any mistakes. 
tBody<-TotalBody, 
Acc<-Acceleration,
Mag<-Magnitude,
fBody<-FourierTransformed, 
#Gyro<-_Gyroscope
I referred to the original codebook, which is available here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
